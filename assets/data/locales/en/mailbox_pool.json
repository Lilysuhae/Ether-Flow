I would have held your hands directly, sharing the anguish within them, instead of guessing your warmth through this barrier. I do not wish to live forever. Just one day, no, even just one hour would be enough to break out of this cylinder and look into your eyes from a breath away. To me, a human moment of aging together is a more dazzling miracle than immortal time gained through alchemy. In the quiet night, I pray: that one day my soul might defy the laws of alchemy and reach your true skin. Without your warmth, I am but an illusion. I love you, my entire universe.",
